This is a repository for a data, used in the "How to Build a Text Mining, Machine Learning Document 
Classification System in R!" video by Timothy DAuria (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1V2McKbkLo#).
The data (speeches) used in this video is not avialable on the web, so I genereated a random data 
and put it here. You will need to replace 'romney' and 'obama' folders discussed in the video with 
the appropriate folder in this repository.
